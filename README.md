# Student success-EDA-Prediction
This project explores the key factors influencing student academic performance and success using data-driven analysis. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable insights that can help educators and institutions improve student outcomes.
We test various models for predicting student scores based on parameters given.

## Objectives
* Identify which features most strongly correlate with student success
* Explore the impact of variables such as parental education, test preparation, gender, and study time
* Build ML model to predict score of students.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
